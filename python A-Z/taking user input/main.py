#taking user input in python-- In python, we can take user input directly by using input() function.This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable
a = input("enter number: ")
b = input("enter number: ")
print(a+b)             # it assume all the variable as string
print(int(a)+int(b))   # there we need to initialize datatype of our variable- "int"
