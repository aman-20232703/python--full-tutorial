#  Some of the data types have higher-order, and some have lower order. While performing any operations on variables with different data types in Python, one of the variable's data types will be changed to the higher data type. According to the level, one data type is converted into other by the Python interpreter itself (automatically). This is called, implicit typecasting in python.

b=2.9
c=3
d=b+c
print("addition is:",d)  # implicit typecasting(python intrpreter automatically convert it according to requirement)
print("type of this variable",type(d))
