#### Welcome to the ultimate Python tutorial repository! This project covers everything from the basics to advanced-level topics in Python programming, explained with practical examples, comments, and clean formatting.

## What You'll Learn
### Python Fundamentals
#### Print statements, comments, and escape characters

#### Variables and data types

#### Type casting (explicit & implicit)

#### User input handling

#### String slicing and string methods

---

### Operators
#### Arithmetic, relational, logical, and shorthand operators

#### Control flow: if-else, elif, nested if, match-case

### Loops & Flow Control
#### for, while, else with loops

#### break, continue, pass statements

#### Reverse number, KBC-style question format

---

### Functions
#### Built-in vs user-defined functions

#### Function arguments (default, keyword, *args, **kwargs)

#### Return values, recursion (factorial, Fibonacci)

---

### Data Structures
#### Lists, list methods, and list comprehensions

#### Tuples and tuple methods

#### Sets, set methods, and operations

#### Dictionaries and their methods

---

### Modules & Packages
#### Built-in modules (math, os, time, etc.)

#### External modules (pypdf, win32com, requests)

#### Using pip for package installation

#### Virtual environments

---

### File Handling
#### Reading, writing, appending, modes (r, w, a, rb, etc.)

#### with context manager, seek(), tell(), readlines(), writelines()

---

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
#### Classes and objects

#### __init__ constructor

#### Class vs instance variables

#### Inheritance (single, multilevel, multiple, hierarchical, hybrid)

#### Method overriding, super(), __str__, __repr__

#### Access modifiers (public, protected, private)

#### Decorators, static and class methods

#### Operator overloading

---

### Requirements
#### Most modules are built-in. However, to use features like PDF handling or TTS:
            ~ pip install pypdf
            ~ pip install requests
            and more.......

### File Structure
#### python.py — The main tutorial file containing code snippets, explanations, and demos.

#### myfile.txt, myfile2.txt, etc. — Files used for file handling exercises.

#### name.py, magic_method.py — Modules used to demonstrate imports and magic methods.

---

### Highlights
#### 100+ examples and explanatory comments

#### Covers both theory and practice

#### Suitable for better understanding

#### Ready to extend for projects, mini apps, or learning paths
